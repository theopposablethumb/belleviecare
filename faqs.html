					<h2 class="small">How do you communicate with my family?</h2>
					<p>We know that keeping in touch with family and friends is important, and together with your family we will look at a range of possible ways to help you stay connected. If you want to do this, we have many different options – for example, this could include a private and confidential Facebook group where we post photos and updates from you, and you family can also post and comment; it could be involve sharing learning and communication logs with your family, or testing or emailing photos. Privacy and confidentiality is very important to us, and so is helping you stay connected – we can do both. Family members can also have access to our care management app Birdie, to read notes about our visits.</p>

We also use associate professionals to provide bespoke training for teams around less common conditions or at end of life, so that we can support people in the most person centred way.

During induction, as well as shadowing experienced staff, they complete a comprehensive suite of e-learning courses. They then undertake face to face training in first aid, safeguarding, medication and moving and assisting, before they can work independently.
